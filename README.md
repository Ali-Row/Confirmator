### Here's how it works:

Once you open up the app you will be presented with a clean and modern user interface.

To begin we click on the tutor sign in button on the top right of the page.

A modal will open up, we fill out our first name then click save, you'll notice your name now appears in place of the default icon, this can be changed at any time.
