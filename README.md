# Welcome to Confirmator

Confirmator is a faster way to send out the next day confirmation emails for Trilogy Education Tutors.

### Here's how it works:

Once you open up the app you will be presented with a clean and modern user interface.

To begin we click on the tutor sign in button on the top right of the page.

A modal will open up, we fill out our first name then click save, you'll notice your name now appears in place of the default icon, this can be changed at any time.

Now we can fill out the fields with all of the necessary information, first the time of the session, then AM or PM, then the students name, email, the zoom link for that particular student and last but not least the students timezone.

Once we click generate you'll notice 2 things will happen, first it renders a preview of the email subject line and body below and secondly it will save the student on the right.
